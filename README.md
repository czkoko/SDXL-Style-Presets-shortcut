# SDXL-Style-Presets-shortcut
Apple shortcut to generate Stable Diffusion XL Style



Since SDXL style presets can only be realized by prompt words for the time being.

with this project, it is suitable for generators that do not support style presets, such as:

`MochiDiffusion.app, diffusers.app, Guernika.app`

Just right-click to select the current prompt word >> Select the style, and you can automatically create a stylized prompt for you.

Stylized prompts come from the public network and are slightly modified. Although there is a lack of negative prompt support, they can basically generate pictures that are in line with the style, Some styles are also applicable to SD 1.5.
